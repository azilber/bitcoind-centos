This fork is more of a scratchpad for me.  Please look at the original project (https://github.com/weex/bitcoind-centos) if you want to use the scripts.
This is more of a mess if specific makefiles that I've been tinkering with.  I use the google performance tools, with all libs end everything living in /opt/coins,
which contains:

.
├── bin
├── build
├── configs
├── control
├── daemons
├── data
├── docs
├── include
├── lib
├── mint
├── openssl
└── run

Keep and eye on https://github.com/azilber/walletserver if you're interested in this.


OLD README:
This project helps you build bitcoind on CentOS / Redhat and consists of a makefile and bash script. There is no need to modify the username in the makefile as the shell script takes care of it.

This was tested on 64-bit version of CentOS 6.

Support for tcmalloc added.
